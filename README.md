# SwiftBar-Zoom-Plugins
Three (3x) AppleScripts to be used with SwiftBar to display the 'current/in progress' Zoom.us meeting status of:

Mute State: 'Muted' or 'Live Mic'
Video State: 'No Video' or 'Live Video'
Screenshare State: '' or Screenshare active'

Displayed in the menubar.

The majority the AppleScript code came from other people!
